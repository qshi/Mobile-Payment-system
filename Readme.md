This project is a brief payment system based on client-server architecture. We simulated the SSL protocol with DH key exchange algorithm. We also used AES encryption algorithm during the communication between client and server. To improve the secureity of a payment system, use added the email confirmation in this project. When a masquerader pick up some one's bank card, he still need to have a emailed confirmation code to accomplish the payment. Thus the system is safer than that only need card information to make a payment.
